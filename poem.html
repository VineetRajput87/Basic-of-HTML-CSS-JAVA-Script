        <pre style="text-align:center;">One moment I was in the air, Above the clouds, nowhere to be found. <br>One moment I was bekow the Earth, In its core I was bound.<br>One moment I was in a palace, And the other in a cottage so small. <br>Ome moment I was happy with a stick And the other, I hated my expensive ball. <br><br>Time changes as we go, <br>We can't follow it; it just goes,<br>Time is precious <br>So this is what we learnt folks!</pre>
